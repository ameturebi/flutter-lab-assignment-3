# Flutter Lab Assignment 3

This Flutter application fetches and displays a list of albums and photos from the [JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com). The app demonstrates clean architecture using the MVVM pattern, Bloc state management, GoRouter for navigation, and proper error handling.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Fetch albums and photos from remote API
- Display albums in a scrollable list
- Navigate to a detail screen on item tap
- Show full album details including photo
- Loading and error states with retry option

## ðŸ§± Architecture

This app is structured using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture:

- **Model**: Defines the data structure for Album and Photo
- **View**: UI components built using Flutter widgets
- **ViewModel (Bloc)**: Handles logic, state management, and API calls
